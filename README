h1. Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to make available to the public a
SPRING-ROO/GWT based sample application with user authentication
enabled (since I couldn't find a single decent example for doing
this). It does not do a whole lot; it merely sets up a few additional
items on top of ROO's generated code to enable security and add a
login dialog.

Note #1: this project adds a small Jquery (I know that it's not
consistent with dojo usage in the rest of spring, but this is what I
am familiar with. I also know that it's not in the spirit of GWT to
use JS code, but use it as a starting example and rip it apart as you
please!)

Note #2: there is no logout code yet, and there's no user
administration GUI.

h2. Setup steps I followed to create this project:

# Download roo and install (version 1.2.1)
# Get expenses.roo from samples dir inside ROO distro and make minor changes (see the modified file in the root of this repo). mainly added "security setup" at the _right place_ (order is important)
# Make some xml changes to setup security (see checkin history to see what they are)
# Hack together some JS code to put a login dialog together.
